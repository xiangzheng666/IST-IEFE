# IST-IEFE

## Two Versions

We release both ```Keras``` and ```PyTorch``` code of our approach, in the ```keras``` and ```pytorch``` folders, respectively.

- The ```Keras``` folder contains the code to run the experiments presented in the paper. The code is frozen to what it was when we originally wrote the paper. (NOTE: we modified some deprecated API invocations to fit for the latest Keras and theano).

- The ```PyTorch``` is the bleeding-edge reporitory where we packaged it up, improved the code quality and added some features.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note that the PyTorch version is problematic at present. For those who want to replicate QESIE as a baseline model, it is highly recommended to check out the Keras version. This could greatly save your time and effort**.

ü§ó Nevertheless, if you are interested in using and improving QESIE, check out the PyTorch version and feel free to contribute.

For more information, please refer to the README files under the directory of each component.



## Two Datasets

##We only uploaded the dataset we constructed, the other two datasets are communal datasets, so they were not uploaded.

## If you need them, please download them from the following URL.

the dataset crawled by Gu: "https://github.com/guxd/deep-code-search"
the CodesearchNet dataset: "https://github.com/github/CodeSearchNet"
